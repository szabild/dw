        "# Understanding APIs and their role in Data Science\n",
        "\n",
        "Data scientists rarely work with ready-made datasets. Instead, they often need to collect and combine data from multiple sources, with web APIs being one of the most common methods for accessing real-time data. **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** are essential in data science because they provide a standardized way to access, retrieve, and integrate data from different sources. Picture an API as a restaurant's menu and ordering system combined. When you want specific data, you make a request following the API's prescribed format - similar to ordering a dish from a menu. The API processes your request and returns the data in a structured format, just as a kitchen prepares and serves your meal according to the menu's description.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note: Some APIs require **authentication** to control access and ensure fair usage. This is commonly implemented using *API keys*, which are unique identifiers that must be included in requests. The APIs we will use don't require such keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Calling an API Using the Browser**\n",
        "Most public APIs that do not require authentication can be accessed directly from a web browser. This allows you to test an API quickly without writing any code.\n",
        "\n",
        "The [**RestCountries API**](https://restcountries.com) provides information about countries, including capitals, currencies, and geographic coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "To get details about **Hungary**, open your web browser and enter the following URL in the address bar:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/hungary\n",
        "```\n",

        "- Commercial purposes.\n",

        "## 2. Understanding API Documentation\n",
        "\n",
        "API documentation serves as a user manual for developers, explaining how to interact with the API efficiently and correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why API Documentation Matters**\n",
        "\n",
        "API documentation provides:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Endpoint details**: The specific URLs to which requests should be sent.\n",
        "- **Request parameters**: Input data required for specific queries.\n",
        "- **Authentication requirements**: Whether an API key or token is needed.\n",
        "- **Rate limits**: The number of requests allowed per time period.\n",
        "- **Response format**: The structure in which data is returned (e.g., JSON, XML).\n",
        "- **Error handling**: How errors are reported and what responses to expect.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example: RestCountries API**\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand how API documentation is structured, let's examine the **RestCountries API**, which provides country-related data such as capital cities, currencies, and geographic coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 1: Identify the Base URL**\n",
        "\n",
        "A base URL is the main web address of an API, serving as the foundation for all requests. API endpoints are added to this base URL to access specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To find the base URL, look at the API documentation under sections like \"Base URL\" or \"Endpoints Overview.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The base URL for the **RestCountries API** is:\n",
        "\n",
        "```text\n",
        "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 2: Identify Relevant Parameters**\n",
        "\n",
        "To request data about a specific country, we use the `/name/{country}` endpoint. This endpoint is found by consulting the API documentation, typically under sections like \"Available Endpoints\" or \"Data Retrieval.\" The documentation will outline the structure of requests, including required parameters and possible response formats. For example, to fetch details about Hungary, we use:\n",
        "\n",
        "```text\n",
        "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/hungary\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Step 3: Inspect the Response Format**\n",
        "\n",
        "Before analyzing the JSON response, take a moment to think about its structure. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) organizes data in a readable format using:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`[]`**\\*\\* (square brackets)\\*\\*: Represent arrays (lists of items).\n",
        "- **`{}`**\\*\\* (curly brackets)\\*\\*: Represent objects (key-value pairs).\n",
        "- **`\"\": {}`**\\*\\* (nested objects)\\*\\*: Represent key-value pairs where the value itself is another object containing additional key-value pairs.\n",
        "- **`\"\": []`**\\*\\* (arrays within objects)\\*\\*: Represent key-value pairs where the value is an array (a list of multiple values).\n",
